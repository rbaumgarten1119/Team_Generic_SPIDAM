Project-Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling

This project is for the use of breaking down audio files to measure the reverberation and varying frequencies over time.
In this repository, there are three different classes: a Model class, a Controller class, and a View class. The Model class holds the information related to the raw audio data and its processing. This processed information is then passed through the Controller class, which handles the GUI and commands for View class. The View class then displays data and graphs for audio file being read.
The sample audio provided in both .mp3 and .wav format was used for testing the program, and it was recorded with a microphone from the Florida Polytechnic University SIM Lab. The audio file is an edited recording of a clap from a distance of 3 meters (measured with a meterstick).
